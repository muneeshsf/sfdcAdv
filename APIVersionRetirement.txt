Event Tpe API captures all API calls made to your org. (SOAP, REST, BUlk etc)
use it to detect deprecated versions, fomd slow API consumers

By utilizing the API Total Usage event type, you can effectively track the API versions being used by your integrations and 
identify requests originating from older or unsupported versions. This helps you manage your 
API version strategy and ensure that your integrations remain up to date. 

Track API Version Use with the API Total Usage Event
Gain visibility into API version use with the "API Total Usage" event type in the EventLogFile object. This event type helps you 
streamline your API version management strategy and plans. You can also use it to monitor your general API consumption. 
This event records calls to SOAP, Bulk v1, and REST API requests up to version 30.0. 

Track API Usage for API Versions 31–49
Use the API Total Usage event type to monitor details of requests made from versions 31–49 of the Platform SOAP API, 
Platform REST API, and Bulk API. Previously, this event type monitored API usage through version 30. Using the API Total 
Usage event type can help you identify requests from old and unsupported API versions.

Salesforce Platform API Versions 21.0 through 30.0 Retirement

hese API versions will be retired. Applications that consume the versions will be disrupted because calls fail and
 respond with an error that the requested endpoint is not found and can’t be processed by the platform. Below are the errors:

REST API returns 410: GONE.
SOAP API returns 500: UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION.
Bulk API returns 400: InvalidVersion.

This retirement affects any code, package, application, or integration executing a request
 of versions 21.0 through 30.0 SOAP, REST, or Bulk API.
